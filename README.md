# Project Overview

This project is a Node.js application built with Express.js and TypeScript. It follows a modular structure with dedicated directories for different functionalities.

## Core Components:

- **`app.ts`**: The main application file, responsible for setting up the Express app, including middleware (CORS, JSON body parsing, URL encoding), request logging, and global error handling. It also imports routes and initializes database connection and other plugins/jobs.

- **`server.ts`**: This file starts the Express server and listens on the port defined in the configuration.

- **`database.ts`**: Handles the MongoDB connection using Mongoose. It establishes the connection, logs connection events (connected, error, disconnected), and exports the Mongoose connection object.

- **`config/`**: Contains application-wide configurations, such as port numbers and database URIs.
  - **`config.ts`**: Defines environment variables and configurations for the application.

- **`routes/`**: Defines the API endpoints.
  - **`index.ts`**: Likely consolidates all other route files.
  - **`user.routes.ts`**: Defines routes related to user management.
  - **`webhook.route.ts`**: Defines routes for handling webhooks.

- **`middlewares/`**: Contains Express middleware functions, such as `errorHandler.ts`.

- ****`plugins/`**: Integrates external plugins, like `telegram.ts`.

- **`jobs/`**: Contains background jobs or scheduled tasks, such as `listener.job.ts`.

- **`library/`**: Utility functions, like `logging.utils.ts` for logging.

- **`controllers/`**: (Presumed) Contains the logic for handling requests from routes.

- **`services/`**: (Presumed) Contains business logic and interacts with the database or external APIs.

- **`utils.ts`**: General utility functions.
